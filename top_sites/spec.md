# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [X] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application: cli.rb runs a loop allowing users to look at information about top sites
- [X] Pull data from an external source: Using Nokogiri, I scrape data from the Alexa top sites rankings
- [X] Implement both list and detail views: There is a list of the top 50 sites, and users can dril down into each one.
